TI  - Effects of daphnetin on the mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
      induced by HMGB1 in human lung adenocarcinoma cells (A549 cell line).

AB  - As a cancer with the highest incidence in recent years, lung cancer is mainly 
      composed of three diseases: non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer 
      and neuroendocrine tumor. The morbidity and mortality of this malignant tumor are 
      the highest in both male and female populations worldwide. In my country, lung 
      cancer has become the most common cancer disease and the leading cause of cancer 
      death, so it is extremely important to find lung cancer therapeutic targets. 
      Based on previous studies, we speculated that the TLR4-Myd88-NFκB pathway may be 
      involved in hmgb1-induced EMT in A549 cells, and daphnetin may also inhibit 
      hmgb1-induced EMT through the TLR4-Myd88-NFκB pathway in A549 cells, but related 
      studies have not linked it to hmgb1-induced EMT. Therefore, the innovation of 
      this study is to test these two conjectures and analyze how daphnetin affects the 
      epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanism induced by HMGB1 in human lung 
      adenocarcinoma cells (A549 cell line), aiming at lung adenocarcinoma cells, 
      foundation for clinical treatment. The proliferation rate and the migrating cell 
      number presented an obvious decrease in the HMGB1+TLR4-shRNA group and the 
      HMGB1+daphnetin group relative to the HMGB1 group (P < 0.0001). The intracellular 
      expression of TLR4, Myd88, NFκB, vimentin and snail1 proteins were significantly 
      decreased (P < 0.001), while that of E-cadherin presented a remarkable increase 
      (P < 0.001) in the HMGB1+TLR4-shRNA and HMGB1+daphnetin group compared with the 
      HMGB1 group. TLR4-MyD88-NFκB pathway is associated with HMGB1-induced EMT in A549 
      cells. Daphnetin had an inhibitory effect on HMGB1-induced EMT via the 
      TLR4-Myd88-NF-κB pathway in A549 cells.

TI  - Long-term results of liver thermal ablation in patients with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma and colorectal cancer liver metastasis regarding spatial features and 
      tumor-specific variables.
LID - 10.4274/dir.2023.221986 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM) and hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC) are widely treated using microwave and radiofrequency ablation. Local tumor 
      progression (LTP) may develop depending on the shortest vascular distance and 
      large lesion diameter. This study aims to explore the effect of these spatial 
      features and to investigate the correlation between tumor-specific variables and 
      LTP. METHODS: This is a retrospective study covering the period between January 
      2007 and January 2019. One hundred twenty-five patients (CRLM: HCC: 64:61) with 
      262 lesions (CRLM: HCC: 142:120) were enrolled. The correlation between LTP and 
      the variables was analyzed using the chi-square test, Fischer's exact test, or 
      the Fisher-Freeman-Halton test where applicable. The local progression-free 
      survival (Loc-PFS) was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariable and 
      multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed to identify prognostic 
      factors. RESULTS: Significant correlations were observed for LTP in both CRLM and 
      HCC at a lesion diameter of 30-50 mm (P = 0.019 and P < 0.001, respectively) and 
      SVD of ≤3 mm (P < 0.001 for both). No correlation was found between the ablation 
      type and LTP (CRLM: P = 0.141; HCC: P = 0.771). There was no relationship between 
      residue and the ablation type, but a strong correlation with tumor size was 
      observed (P = 0.127 and P < 0.001, respectively). In CRLM, LTP was associated 
      with mutant K-ras and concomitant lung metastasis (P < 0.001 and P = 0.003, 
      respectively). In HCC, a similar correlation was found for Child-Pugh B, serum 
      alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level of >10 ng/mL, predisposing factors, and moderate 
      histopathological differentiation (P < 0.001, P = 0.008, P = 0.027, and P <0.001, 
      respectively). In CRLM, SVD of ≤3 mm proved to be the variable with the greatest 
      negative effect on Loc-PFS (P = 0.007), followed by concomitant lung metastasis 
      (P = 0.027). In HCC, a serum AFP level of >10 ng/mL proved to be the variable 
      with the greatest negative effect on Loc-PFS (P = 0.045). CONCLUSION: In addition 
      to the lesions' spatial features, tumor-specific variables may also have an 
      impact on LTP.

TI  - Lymphocytopenia and survival after whole-brain radiotherapy in patients with 
      small-cell lung cancer.
LID - 10.1111/1759-7714.14868 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate whether whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) decreases 
      lymphocyte counts and evaluate the impact of treatment-related lymphopenia on 
      survival in patients with brain metastasis. METHODS: Medical records from 60 
      small-cell lung cancer patients treated with WBRT from January 2010 to December 
      2018 were included in the study. Total lymphocyte count (TLC) was obtained pre 
      and post treatment (within 1 month). We performed linear and logistic regression 
      analyses to identify predictors of lymphopenia. The association between 
      lymphopenia and survival was analyzed using Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-nine patients (65%) developed treatment-related lymphopenia. The median 
      TLC decrease was -374 cells/μL (interquartile range -50 to -722, p < 0.001). 
      Baseline lymphocyte count was a significant predictor of TLC difference and 
      percentage change in TLC. Logistic regression analysis found male sex (odds ratio 
      [OR] 0.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.00-0.79, p = 0.033) and higher baseline 
      lymphocyte count (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.82-0.99, p = 0.005) were associated with a 
      lower risk of developing ≥grade 2 treatment-related lymphopenia. Cox regression 
      analysis showed that age at brain metastasis (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% CI 
      1.01-1.05, p = 0.013), ≥grade 2 treatment-related lymphopenia, and percentage 
      change in TLC (per 10%, HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.89-0.99, p = 0.032) were prognostic 
      factors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: WBRT decreases TLC and the magnitude of 
      treatment-related lymphopenia is an independent predictor of survival in 
      small-cell lung cancer patients.

TI  - LncRNA LITATS1 suppresses TGF-β-induced EMT and cancer cell plasticity by 
      potentiating TβRI degradation.
PG  - e112806
LID - 10.15252/embj.2022112806 [doi]
AB  - Epithelial cells acquire mesenchymal phenotypes through epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) during cancer progression. However, how epithelial cells retain 
      their epithelial traits and prevent malignant transformation is not well 
      understood. Here, we report that the long noncoding RNA LITATS1 (LINC01137, 
      ZC3H12A-DT) is an epithelial gatekeeper in normal epithelial cells and inhibits 
      EMT in breast and non-small cell lung cancer cells. Transcriptome analysis 
      identified LITATS1 as a TGF-β target gene. LITATS1 expression is reduced in lung 
      adenocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and correlates with 
      a favorable prognosis in breast and non-small cell lung cancer patients. LITATS1 
      depletion promotes TGF-β-induced EMT, migration, and extravasation in cancer 
      cells. Unbiased pathway analysis demonstrated that LITATS1 knockdown potently and 
      selectively potentiates TGF-β/SMAD signaling. Mechanistically, LITATS1 enhances 
      the polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of TGF-β type I receptor 
      (TβRI). LITATS1 interacts with TβRI and the E3 ligase SMURF2, promoting the 
      cytoplasmic retention of SMURF2. Our findings highlight a protective function of 
      LITATS1 in epithelial integrity maintenance through the attenuation of TGF-β/SMAD 
      signaling and EMT.

TI  - Influencing factors of efficacy and long-term use of amrubicin in patients with 
      small cell lung cancer.
LID - 10.1111/1759-7714.14871 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amrubicin (AMR) has become the standard of care for post-relapse 
      small cell lung cancer (SCLC). It has also been reported to achieve long-term 
      disease control in patients with good treatment response. However, the optimal 
      patient population for whom AMR is effective and the factors associated with 
      long-term disease control are yet to be identified. The aim of the study was to 
      identify the clinical characteristics and factors associated with long-term 
      disease control in patients with recurrent SCLC who would benefit from AMR 
      therapy. METHODS: The clinical records of 33 patients diagnosed with recurrent 
      SCLC and treated with AMR were retrospectively reviewed. Clinical information was 
      compared between patients who achieved disease control (effective group) and who 
      developed disease progression (noneffective group) on the first efficacy 
      assessment after AMR and between patients who continued AMR for more than 
      seven cycles (maintenance group) and those who terminated treatment after 
      1-6 cycles (discontinuation group). RESULTS: The noneffective group included 
      significantly more patients with AMR dose reductions after the second cycle 
      (p = 0.006). AMR dose reduction was an independent risk factor for disease 
      progression. The maintenance group had significantly lower pretreatment lactate 
      dehydrogenase (LDH) levels than the discontinuation group (p = 0.046). A high LDH 
      level was an independent risk factor for short AMR discontinuation. Overall 
      survival was significantly longer in the effective group than in the noneffective 
      group (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In AMR therapy for patients with relapsed SCLC, 
      continuation of AMR without dose reduction after the second cycle may contribute 
      to disease control and prolonged survival.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Smoking is associated with increased mortality in patients with 
      cancer. However, there are limited data on the impact of smoking on the survival 
      of patients with brain metastases. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate 
      whether smoking was associated with survival and whether smoking cessation was 
      beneficial to these patients. METHODS: This study used lung cancer with a brain 
      metastasis cohort of the West China Hospital of Sichuan University from 2013 to 
      2021. Patients were stratified according to smoking history; the distribution, 
      clinical characteristics, and survival data of each group were estimated. 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis and risk analysis were performed for the survival endpoint. 
      RESULTS: Of the 2,647 patients included in the analysis, the median age was 57.8 
      years, and 55.4% were men. Among them, 67.1% had no smoking history, 18.9% still 
      smoked, and 14% reported quitting smoking. Compared with never smokers, current 
      smokers [HR, 1.51 (95% CI, 1.35-1.69), p < 0.01] and former smokers [HR, 1.32 
      (95% CI, 1.16-1.49), p<0.01] had an increased risk of death. However, quitting 
      smoking was not associated with improved survival [HR, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.77-1.04), 
      p = 0.16]. The overall survival increased with the increase of smoking cessation 
      years. CONCLUSIONS: In lung cancer patients with brain metastases, smoking was 
      associated with an increased risk of death, but quitting smoking was not 
      associated with improved survival.

AB  - ALK internal deletions of nonkinase domain exons occur in 0.01% of lung cancers 
      with ALK genomic aberrations. We report a lung adenocarcinoma with a previously 
      undescribed somatic ALK deletion of exons 2 to 19 with dramatic and sustained 
      (>23 mo) response to alectinib. Our and other reported cases with ALK nonkinase 
      domain deletions (between introns and exons 1-19) can display positive results in 
      nonsequencing-based lung cancer diagnostic tests (such as immunohistochemistry) 
      used to screen for more common ALK rearrangements. This case report emphasizes 
      that "ALK-driven" lung cancers should be expanded to encompass those harboring 
      not only ALK rearrangements with other genes but also ALK nonkinase domain 
      deletions.

TI  - A Rare Case of Metastatic Small Cell Carcinoma of Lung in a Follow-Up Patient of 
      Chronic Myeloid Leukemia on Imatinib Treatment.
PG  - e35436
LID - 10.7759/cureus.35436 [doi]
AB  - Imatinib has an excellent long-term survival rate and significantly ameliorates 
      the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia during the past few decades. There is 
      now a concern that first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors can cause 
      secondary neoplasms. Here, we describe a case of a 49-year-old non-smoker male 
      who was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia and treated with imatinib. After 
      15 years of treatment, an incidental right cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. 
      The fine needle aspiration cytology from the lymph node revealed the small round 
      cell morphology. In order to identify the primary lesion, computerised tomography 
      of the thorax and abdomen was advised, which revealed a diagnosis of small cell 
      carcinoma lung. In the index case report, we will discuss the potential side 
      effects of first-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors on a long-term basis along 
      with treatment protocols for metastatic small cell carcinoma lung in a 
      disease-free follow-up case of chronic myeloid leukaemia.

      human lung epithelial cancer cells.
PG  - 1076-1086
LID - 10.1016/j.jtumed.2023.02.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. In lung cancer 
      treatment, nebulized solid lipid nanoparticles may be a viable drug delivery 
      method, helping the drug reach sites of action, and improving its inhalation 
      efficiency and pulmonary deposition. This research focused on evaluating the 
      effectiveness of solid lipid nanoparticles of favipiravir (Fav-SLNps) in 
      facilitating drug delivery to sites of action in lung cancer treatment. METHODS: 
      The hot-evaporation method was used to formulate Fav-SLNps. The in vitro cell 
      viability, anti-cancer effects, and cellular uptake activity were evaluated in 
      A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells treated with the Fav-SLNp formulation. 
      RESULTS: The Fav-SLNps were formulated successfully. Importantly, Fav-SLNps at a 
      concentration of 322.6 μg/ml were found to be safe and non-toxic toward 
      A549 cells in vitro. The formulation had potential anti-proliferative properties 
      via increasing the proportions of cells in G2/M and G0/G1 phases to 1.20 and 1.13 
      times those in untreated cells. Additionally, Fav-SLNp treatment significantly 
      induced necrosis in A549 cells. Furthermore, the use of SLNps in the Fav 
      formulation resulted in a macrophage drug uptake 1.23 times that of the free 
      drug. CONCLUSION: Our results confirmed the internalization and anti-cancer 
      activity of the Fav-SLNp formulation in the A549 lung cancer cell line. Our 
      findings suggest that Fav-SLNps could potentially be used as lung cancer 
      treatment to facilitate drug delivery to sites of action in the lungs.

TI  - A novel tool to evaluate and quantify radiation pneumonitis: A retrospective 
      analysis of correlation of dosimetric parameters with volume of pneumonia patch.
PG  - 1130406
LID - 10.3389/fonc.2023.1130406 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In lung cancer, radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) or radiation 
      pneumonitis (RP) are major concerns after radiotherapy. We investigated the 
      correlation between volumes of RP lesions and their RP grades after radiotherapy. 
      METHODS AND MATERIALS: We retrospectively collected data from patients with 
      non-small lung cancer that received curative doses to the thorax without 
      undergoing chest radiotherapy before this treatment course. The post-treatment 
      computed tomography (CT) image was used to register to the planning CT to 
      evaluate the correlation between dosimetric parameters and volume of pneumonia 
      patch by using deformable image registration. RESULTS: From January 1, 2019, to 
      December 30, 2020, 71 patients with non-small cell lung cancer with 169 sets of 
      CT images met our criteria for evaluation. In all patient groups, we found the 
      RPv max and RP grade max to be significant (p<0.001). Some parameters that were 
      related to the dose-volume histogram (DVH) and RP were lung Vx (x=1-66 Gy, 
      percentage of lung volume received ≥x Gy), and mean lung dose. Comparing these 
      parameters of the DVH with RP grade max showed that the mean lung dose and lung 
      V1-V31 were significantly correlated. The cut-off point for the occurrence of 
      symptoms in all patient groups, the RPv max value, was 4.79%, while the area 
      under the curve was 0.779. In the groups with grades 1 and 2 RP, the dose curve 
      of 26 Gy covered ≥80% of RP lesions in >80% of patients. Patients who had 
      radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy had significantly shorter 
      locoregional progression-free survival (p=0.049) than patients who received 
      radiation therapy in combination with target therapy. Patients with RPv max 
      >4.79% demonstrated better OS (p=0.082). CONCLUSION: The percentage of RP lesion 
      volume to total lung volume is a good indicator for quantifying RP. RP lesions 
      can be projected onto the original radiation therapy plan using coverage of the 
      26 Gy isodose line to determine whether the lesion is RILI.
