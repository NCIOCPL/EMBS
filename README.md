# EBMS 4.0

This version of the PDQÂ® Editorial Board Management System has been
rewritten to use Drupal 9.x or later. The project directory was initialized
with the command `composer create-project drupal/recommended-project
ebms4`. After the new version was deployed to production the old repository
was retired and replaced with the new one (renamed from "ebms4" to "ebms").

This page focuses on setting up `Docker` containers for doing
development work on the EBMS, with non-sensitive dummy data which can
be put under version control. Jenkins will be used for refreshing lower
CBIIT tiers from the production server. The `scripts` directory contains
scripts given to CBIIT for deployment of individual releases.

## Prerequisites

MacOS is the only supported environment for EBMS development, as using
Docker on Windows is too painful.
You will need `git`, `homebrew`, `php`, `composer`, and `docker`.
For those tools which are not already installed, follow the instructions
here.

### git

Enable the Mac developer tools which will include things like `git`.

```bash
sudo xcodebuild -license
```

### Homebrew

Run the following command to install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), which is a
package manager for tools not supplied by Apple.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

### PHP
A recent version of PHP is needed (version 8.1 or higher).

1. Run `brew install php@8.1`. It's OK if you end up with a higher version.
2. Follow any additional instructions on the screen. One of this set is adding PHP to your path. Make sure you do that.
3. Edit `/opt/homebrew/etc/php/8.1/php.ini` or `/usr/local/etc/php/8.1/php.ini` and set `memory_limit = -1` (this removes any memory limits, which `composer install` usually hits. `/opt/homebrew` is the location for newer M1 Macs. If `php --version` shows that you're running a later version, you'll need to adjust the path of the file you're editing accordingly.

### Composer

If you have an older Intel-based Mac, run

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer --2
```

For the newer Apple silicon (M1) Macs, the command is:

```bash
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/opt/homebrew/bin --filename=composer --2
```

### Docker

1. Go to https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/
2. Select the right binary for your Mac's architecture
3. Follow the instructions to install.
4. Click on the Docker icon at the top right of your Mac's display
5. Select *Settings*
6. From the menu on the left select *Resources*
7. Make sure *Memory* is at least 6GB
8. Set *Virtual disk limit* to at least 100GB
9. Click **Apply & Restart**

## EBMS Developer Setup

To create a local development environment for this project, perform the following steps.

1. Clone the repository
2. Change current directory to the cloned repository
3. Run `./scripts/create-unversioned-files`
4. Edit the files in the `unversioned` directory, choosing appropriate passwords and other values
5. Run `composer install`
6. Run `docker compose up -d`
7. Run `docker exec -it ebms-web-1 bash`
8. Inside the container, run `./install.sh`
9. Point your favorite browser (other than Safari, which doesn't recognize subdomains without a certificate) to http://ebms.localhost:8081
10. Log in as admin using the password you created in step 4.

## Updated packages.

To update Drupal core (for example, when a new version of Drupal is
released to address serious bugs or security vulnerabilities), run

```bash
chmod 777 web/sites/default
composer update drupal/core "drupal/core-*" --with-all-dependencies
chmod 555 web/sites/default
```

Commit the updated `composer.*` files. When other developers pull down
to those files, they should run

```bash
composer install
```

## Updated Docker configuration

If settings are changed in `docker-compose.yml` or `Dockerfile` you
will need to rebuild the images and containers with

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

## Testing

To run the complete set of regression tests, navigate to the base
directory of the project in the web container and run:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit web/modules/custom
```

You can run tests for just one module, for example:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit web/modules/custom/ebms_review
```

Or even a specific test:

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit web/modules/custom/ebms_article/tests/src/Kernel/SearchTest.php
```
